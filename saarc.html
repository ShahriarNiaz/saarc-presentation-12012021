 <h2> <u> INTRODUCTION </u> </h2> 
     <h4> Here we will discuss on the basis of SAARC as this South Asian States comprises SAARC as their Regional organization. </h4>
     <h2> <u> IMPACT : Positive ? </u>  </h2>
     we  see that SAARC is one of the most poor performing Regional organization across the glove and when we search for the positive impacts of SAARC that  the South Asian states are currently having ,is, tends to zero, now a days. 
    So it is kind of weird, to find positive impacts out of an organization which exists only in name. Except physical connectivity - institutional and people-to-people connectivity is poor. Trust deficit - trade deficit are at peak ; and where is the so-called Mutual cooperation, why SAARC was institutionalized for.

    <p> <h2> <u> Foreign Policy  : </u> </h2>   <br>
        First Of All Let's Discuss The Determinants Of Foreign Policy <br> <br>
        
        1. <strong> Internal : </strong>  <br>
        (A) Size of A State <br> 
        (B) Geography (Location, Climate, Waterways) <br>
        (C) Culture and History <br>
        (D) Social Structure <sup> 1. Regional Imbalance</sup> <sub> 2. Ethnic Conflict </sub> <br>
        (E) Political Organization <br>
        (F) Political Accountability <br>
        (G) Political Leadership <br>
        (H) Role of Media <br>
        (I) <mark> Qualitative Standard of Diplomacy </mark>  <br>
        (J) Military Strength <br>
        (K) States Ideology <br>
        (L) Personality of Ruler <br> <br>
        2.  <strong>External :</strong><br>
        (A) Contemporary World Politics <br>
        (B) International Organizations <br> <br>
        Foreign policy is applied by diplomacy. By the above mentioned landmarks we are going to give a B- grade to our foreign policy and diplomatic strength. <br>
        <mark>    Having this sort of foreign policy and expecting to achieve positive effects from a poor performing Regional organization is beyond reality. Due to trust deficit and other restrictions, <u> REALIST</u> ideology is taken by states, where a <u> LIBERALIST</u> regional structure was much needed for the cooperation among South Asian states. </mark>

<h2> <u> STATECRAFT </u>  </h2>
To understand the statecraft methodology, we will look down to the political orientation and system of Bangladesh. “The Civic Culture” by Almond and Verba is far far away from our reality ; rather I would say, we are somewhere between cognitive and affective orientation which respectively indicates parochial and subject political culture. This means the evaluative orientation and the participant political culture is absent here.( political culture was,very first discussed by Gabriel G. Almond,1956,in an article named 'Comperative Politics') <br> <br>
Now, we will look at , “The Political System” of David Easton(1953) : <br> <br>
<img src="image/the political system.png" alt="" width="1000px">
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, actually why! We are talking about these inside State-crafts positive impact discussion of Bangladesh regarding the “South Asia” term ?  Well, this is completely an internal matter of Bangladesh, whether it will manage to get the benefits that SAARC still allows. <br> <br>
Now,  we are going to look deep down to the political culture of Bangladesh; to the point, we are going to look on the regime(political party) specific point of view. So, we can see that specific regime has different International(or Regional) support bloc, and due to the only G2G relation, relationship status changes when regime changes . <br> <br>
And, we had also showed up the David Easton's “The Political System” to visualize that - in our political environment we do not have (or very low)  people's participation , so,  what we people see are Vogue. <br> <br>
For all these reasons, the term South Asia does not put any positive impact on Bangladesh’s foreign policy and statecraft ; rather we see kneel down foreign policy for the survival of regime. <br> <br>

<div class="six">

   <h2> <u> CONCLUSION : Burden? </u>  </h2> 
 Well, if we look at the well performing regional organizations, for example the European Union, there we see positive impact of regionalism and as a result, to enjoy the benefits of regionalism - their foreign policy and statecrafts are even changed or relaxed (unbinded).<br> While Bangladesh cannot even deliberately mention the benefits nor the existence of SAARC in an international sphere. 
At the end should we indicate the existence of SAARC as unnecessary ?
